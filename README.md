## Run the showcase application

To run the showcase application you have to build it first

`mvn clean install`

Then go to the `target` folder and run

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=<environment>\
 -Dpoi.saml2.credentials[0].location=file:/path/to/keystore\
 -Dpoi.saml2.credentials[0].type=PKCS12\
 -Dpoi.saml2.credentials[0].password=<keystore_password>\
 -Dpoi.saml2.credentials[0].privateAlias=<private_key_alias>\
 -Dpoi.saml2.credentials[0].publicAlias=<public_key_alias>\
 -Dpoi.saml2.credentials[0].usage=DECRYPTION\
 -Doidc.client.id=<client_id>\
 -Doidc.client.secret=<client_secret>\
 -jar pnet-idp-client-showcase-<version>.jar
```

environment: one of `local`, `dev`, `qa`, `prod`. Depending on what IDP you want to use

The keystore needs to contain a certificate that is also configured in the IDP environment you are using.

In order to test the showcase application, use the following links:
- OIDC Authentication: https://localhost:8443/data/authorization?authenticationType=oidc
- OIDC Multi-Factor-Authentication: https://localhost:8443/data/authorization?authenticationType=oidc_mfa
- SAML2 Authentication: https://localhost:8443/data/authorization?authenticationType=saml2
- Forced SAML2 Authentication (even if already authenticated): https://localhost:8443/data/authorization?authenticationType=saml2_force
- SAML2 Multi-Factor-Authentication: https://localhost:8443/data/authorization?authenticationType=saml2_mfa

You may add `&tenant=<UPPERCASE-TENANT>` to the request, in order to force a login, if the tenant (country) of the logged in user does not match the specified value.
